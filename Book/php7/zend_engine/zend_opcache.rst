Zend opcache
============

While PHP is an interpreter, it does not interpret PHP source code directly. Instead, the source code is first parsed
into an abstract syntax tree (AST), which is then compiled to OPcodes (and used to generate classes and other data
structures), which are then passed to the Zend virtual machine (Zend VM) to actually be interpreted.

As you can see, there are quite a few steps involved to run a single PHP file. Without an additional extension, PHP
will perform all of these steps for every single loaded file in every single request. Since usually PHP files don't
change between requests both the parsing and compilation steps will always yield the same result. OPcache is an
extension that caches the OPcodes and data structures like classes between requests to improve performance. The AST is
not used after the compilation step (with the exception of constant expressions) and thus does not need to be cached.

Normally, all the memory allocated during the processing of a request gets freed after the request has been processed.
So to store the compiled OPcodes for future requests OPcache puts them in a shared memory segment (shm) that can not
only be accessed by the same process after the request has finished but also by other processes handling other
requests. This means that if you are using php-fpm with many children they will only store the OPcodes for each PHP
file once in shm. 

This comes with a significant restriction: The OPcodes and other data structures in shm must not be mutated by any
child request (at least not unless these changes should also affect the other processes). If any changes to shm are
made there is a locking mechanism to avoid data races.

The classes and OParrays (arrays of OPcodes, i.e. functions) in shm are mostly immutable. There are currently three
exceptions:

* ``zend_persistent_script.dynamic_members`` stores information about the state of the cached script
* ``zend_class_entry.inheritance_cache`` is extended if a new combination of parent class and interfaces is encountered
* ``zend_op_array.handler`` can be replaced at runtime by the tracing JIT to start executing JITted code

-------

As mentioned in the introduction, shm is shared for all child processes. Thus, no changes can be made to the data
structures living in shm unless 1. the changes are supposed to be reflected in all child processes and 2. the shm
segment has been locked before any changes are written to avoid data races.

Sometimes the data structures contain a field that should be unique per process or request. The ``map_ptr`` mechanism
can be used to achieve this. In short, instead of storing a pointer to per-process data directly (as that would affect
all processes), a unique offset is assigned during compilation. During runtime, local memory is allocated to hold
enough space for all the entries referenced in these offsets. Each offset then corresponds to an item in the local
memory segment without needing to know the per-process location of the exact element.

Here is an example from php-src. Classes can contain data that needs to be evaluated at runtime, called
``mutable_data``. This ``mutable_data`` contains fields like ``default_properties_table``, ``constants_table`` and more.
``ZEND_MAP_PTR_DEF`` can be used to declare a field that holds the offset into local memory.

    struct _zend_class_entry {
        // ...
        ZEND_MAP_PTR_DEF(zend_class_mutable_data*, mutable_data);
        // ...
    };

``ZEND_MAP_PTR_INIT`` assigns a value directly to the underlying offset field. This must only be done when the
structure is not yet in shm.

    ZEND_MAP_PTR_INIT(ce->mutable_data, NULL);

``ZEND_MAP_PTR_NEW`` can be used to generate a new offset and store it in the given field. This must only be done when
the structure is not yet in shm.

    ZEND_MAP_PTR_NEW(ce->mutable_data);

Once an offset has been assigned to the map ptr ``ZEND_MAP_PTR_SET_IMM`` can be used to assign the value in local memory
with the given offset stored in the map ptr.

    ZEND_MAP_PTR_SET_IMM(class_type->mutable_data, mutable_data);

And to retrieve the value from local memory ``ZEND_MAP_PTR_GET_IMM`` can be used.

    zend_class_mutable_data *mutable_data = ZEND_MAP_PTR_GET_IMM(class_type->mutable_data);

To summarize, with this mechanism, the relative offset ``mutable_data`` is the same for each process. The local map
itself lives at a different address in each process. The associated item will be retrieved by adding the given offset
to the base of the map.

The map ptr can also store real pointers. This can be useful when the data structure doesn't live in shm and thus
doesn't need to store the value in a separate map. The fact that pointers are aligned by their size is used to
differenciate between offsets and real pointers. The offset start at 1, 9, 17, etc (assuming a 64-bit pointer size).
However, pointers (unless padding was removed) would not get aligned this way. Instead, they would be stored in
addresses that end with 0x0 or 0x8 given that they are 8-byte aligned.

To store a real pointer you can use the ``ZEND_MAP_PTR_INIT`` macro. To retrieve a pointer regardless of whether a real
pointer or an offset is stored use the ``ZEND_MAP_PTR_GET`` macro. There's also the ``ZEND_MAP_PTR_SET`` macro that will
call ``ZEND_MAP_PTR_SET_IMM`` or ``ZEND_MAP_PTR_INIT`` depending on whether an offset is already stored in the map ptr.
